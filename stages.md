## Station A: Flashlight


### Station 0: solderless breadboard circuit

1. prototyping with solderless breadboards
2. CR2032 battery
3. CR2032 battery case
4. Favorite LED (test first directly with battery)

### Station 1: pcb flashlight with switch

#### Materials:

1. pcb section
2. CR2032 battery
3. CR2032 battery case
4. Favorite LED (test first directly with battery)


### Station 2: Surface Mount -- tweezers and soldering irons, also flux


* surface mount led's with resistors


## Station B: Make-a-duino.

Start with prototyping board.
isolating those components you need.
programming the arduino

Programming the attiny via the arduino.
Programming tssop packaged arduino (really small pcb must be specialized)

## Station C: Fancy Chip soldering

### Station A: smaller smds!

* solder paste
* reflow ovens

### Station B:

* Paste && Wick Soldering
* msops and tssops

### Station ???: Hot Air Rework 

* msop and many sops
* Ball Grid Array -- hot air rework station

Make -- your phone.
